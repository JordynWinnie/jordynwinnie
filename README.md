# About Me üôè
I'm **Jordan Khong**, a 20 year old part time teaching assistant residing in Singapore. I teach about the C# Language, .NET Core Web development and WinForms.

 When young, I was really interested in computers and games. I played the Nintendo Wii a lot and tried making small flash games. To further pursure this interest, I took up a **Game Design and Development Diploma in Temasek Polytechnic.** I graduated in 2022.

C# is my language of choice to do development. I have used it to develop games with **Unity**, web applications with **Blazor** and Desktop applications with **Winforms**.

I learnt Android with Java intially, but then moved over to use Kotlin due to **Jetpack Compose**, which is a declarative UI framework for Android.
